            <h2>Waste <br /> Management <br /> Incentive</h2>
            <p className="paragraph">Toronto and other C40 cities strive to provide the cleanest possible environment to its citizens living in highly urbanized areas. To fulfill those goals the cities arranged a specific plan to confront climate crises in multiple areas of industry and life including waste management. Due to the fact that the city of Toronto arrange and applied a waste management program - "On the Road to Zero Waste" to "divert as much waste as possible from landfill". The visualization aims to present the amount of garbage that will be diverted year by year to provide a comparison of how much waste can be saved in that relatively short period of time from 3900 tonnes in 2017 up to 200560 tonnes in 2026 "extending Toronto's landfill's life and help Toronto take its first steps towards a zero-waste future".
